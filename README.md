# StayEase - Booking Website

**StayEase** is a web application designed to enable users to browse and book listings (e.g., hotels, properties, or other accommodation options). The project is still under development and aims to provide a seamless booking experience, with features such as listing management, reviews, and user authentication.

## Current Features

- **User Listings**: Users can create and view different listings for available accommodations (e.g., properties, hotels).
- **Listing Management**: Admins can add, edit, and delete listings.
- **Reviews**: Users can leave reviews and ratings for the listings.
- **Basic UI**: Clean, user-friendly interface built with Bootstrap and custom CSS.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout for an optimal experience on all devices.
- **Authentication (Planned)**: User login and registration (coming soon).
- **Payment Integration (Planned)**: Secure online payment options (coming soon).

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js and Express.js for building the server and handling requests.
  - MongoDB with Mongoose for database management and schema definition.
  - Handlebars (or EJS) for dynamic HTML rendering.
- **Frontend**:

  - Bootstrap 5 for responsive layout and design components.
  - Custom CSS for tailored styling.
  - FontAwesome for icons.

- **Authentication**:
  - Placeholder for implementing authentication (JWT or session-based login).

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v22.x or above)
- MongoDB Atlas (for cloud database) or local MongoDB installation

### Steps to Run Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pprachhiii/StayEase.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd StayEase
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Create `.env` file**:  
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Update the `.env` file with your MongoDB credentials.

5. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   nodemon app.js
   ```
   The application will start at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Future Improvements

StayEase is a work-in-progress, and I have several planned features and enhancements to be implemented in the future:

- **User Authentication**: Secure user login and registration (JWT or Session-based).
- **Payment Integration**: Integration of a payment gateway to facilitate booking payments.
- **Advanced Search**: Filters and search options to help users find listings based on various criteria (price, location, ratings).
- **Booking System**: Allow users to book listings and manage reservations.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admin interface to manage users, listings, and reviews.
- **Improved UI/UX**: More refined designs and interactivity, including form validation, loading states, and animations.

## Project Status

This project is **in progress**, and while the core features have been implemented, further improvements are continuously being added. This site is intended for learning and will be further developed to enhance its functionality and usability.

# Server Port
PORT=5000
```

### Notes
